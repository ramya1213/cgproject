# cgproject
Computer graphics project 
The main aim of our project is to demonstrate “ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION THROUGH WIND MILL” ,which shows how efficiently we make use of wind energy to produce electricity.We have used OpenGL software to depict  generation of electricity, due to rotation  of  blades of  wind mill .Electricity is generated by using Renewable resource such as wind. It is of low cost. To encourage more usage of renewable resources, to reduce pollution and generation of electricity to the village are the main aims of our project. Interactions has been provided using mouse (through the use of menus). We have implemented this project using OpenGL and Microsoft Visual C++.
